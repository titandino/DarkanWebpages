  <h4>Darkan is a 727 server targeted at entirely emulating how RS was during 2012, but optionally with some quality of life changes and nerfs to overpowered content as seen fit by both the players and developers. I will not accept any payments in return for any benefits ingame and the integrity of the game will be strongly maintained with a zero donation benefit policy.</h4>
